🏨 WeekendGo – Intelligent Online Hotel Booking System
====================================================

📌 Project Description
---------------------
WeekendGo is a web-based hotel search and booking system designed to help users
find, compare, and book hotels online. Along with core booking features, the
system integrates 🤖 Machine Learning techniques such as Sentiment Analysis and
Fraud Detection to enhance user decision-making and improve booking security.

This project was developed as a 👥 group project and focuses on solving real-
world problems in the online travel and hospitality domain.

----------------------------------------------------

❓ Problem Statement
-------------------
Most hotel booking platforms display raw customer reviews without meaningful
insights and lack intelligent mechanisms to detect fraudulent bookings.
Users find it difficult to evaluate hotel quality, and admins struggle to
monitor suspicious activities effectively.

WeekendGo addresses these issues using Machine Learning models that analyze
hotel reviews and booking behavior.

----------------------------------------------------

🎯 Objectives
-------------
- Provide a simple and user-friendly hotel booking platform
- Help users evaluate hotels using 😊😐😞 sentiment analysis of reviews
- Detect suspicious and fraudulent booking patterns
- Improve platform security and admin monitoring
- Deliver a responsive and smooth user experience

----------------------------------------------------

✨ Key Features
--------------

🔍 1. Hotel Search & Booking
- Search hotels by 📍 location, 💰 price range, ⭐ ratings, and 🛎 amenities
- View hotel details including 🖼 images, 📝 descriptions, and 🗣 reviews
- Book hotel rooms using a 🔐 secure payment gateway

----------------------------------------------------

🤖 2. Machine Learning Features

🧠 a) Sentiment Analysis
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer reviews
- Classifies reviews into:
  - 😊 Positive
  - 😐 Neutral
  - 😞 Negative
- Displays overall hotel sentiment for quick understanding

✔ Benefit:
Users can easily judge hotel quality without reading all reviews.

----------------------------------------------------

🛡 b) Fraud Detection
- Detects suspicious booking activities such as:
  - ⚠ Multiple rapid bookings
  - ⚠ Unusual transaction amounts
  - ⚠ Repeated failed payment attempts
- Uses ML models like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest

✔ Benefit:
Improves booking security and reduces fraudulent transactions.

🧑‍💻 3. User Interface
- Clean and responsive UI design
- Compatible with 💻 desktop and 📱 mobile devices
- Simple and smooth booking workflow

----------------------------------------------------

🛠 4. Admin Dashboard
- Manage 🏨 hotels, 🛏 rooms, 👤 users, and 📄 bookings
- View 🚨 fraud alerts generated by ML models
- Analyze 📊 sentiment summaries of hotel reviews
